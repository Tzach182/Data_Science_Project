# Research Question: Can We Predict Metacritic Game Score
**by: Tzach Fleischer and Moshe Dego**

The video game industry is a billion dollar industry, and part of everday life for most people.
Metacritic is an aggregator site - The site collects reviews from many video game outlets and gives a total aggregated score of each game.

We chose this project out of our mutual love of video games, both of us have been gamers all our lives.

The project is divided into 4 parts:
- Data Collection: Also copied into Scraper V4 as a python file - The scraper of the site and creation of the dataset.
- Data Handling: Reviewing the data and cleaning it for analyzing and modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Graphs of the data for better understanding of the dataset.
- Advanced Data Analysis: normalizing the data and creating 4 machine learning models: Linear regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN.

Also we added the dataset csv's:
- game_score_database: the raw dataset as scraped for Metacritic.com.
- game_score_database_no_dup_expanded_genres: the dataset without duplication and with expanded columns of genres(see Data Handling for further explanation)
- dataframe_for_visual: the dataset we used for the analysis and plotting.
- dataframe_for_model: the dataset we used on the models
